# add-repo-js-tooling

Very opinionated set of tools/presets I tend to use in most of my JS/TS repositories
Adds some tools to the js repo this: pre-commit, commitlint, prettier, editorconfig, ...

This is just a first implementation and mainly meant for my own usage.

The current implementation is very brittle, not a lot of safety checks, hardening ... has been added.
